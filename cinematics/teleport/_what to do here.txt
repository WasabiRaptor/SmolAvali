These are the files used for the beam up and beam down loading cinematics/screens. You should recolor them using
the "effectDirectives" in your .species file, so that the beam is the same color as the beam up and beam down
animations shown when the player get's beamed to and from a world, instance or ship.

When renaming files please make sure that the name of the files follow these templates:
   Cinematic file: teleport_<YourRaceId>.cinematic
   Up frames file: up_<YourRaceId>.frames
  Up sprite sheet: up_<YourRaceId>.png
 Down frames file: warpdown_<YourRaceId>.frames
Down sprite sheet: warpdown_<YourRaceId>.png

deploy pod related:
   Cinematic file: deploy_<YourRaceId>.cinematic
   Up frames file: deploypod_<YourRaceId>.frames
  Up sprite sheet: deploypod_<YourRaceId>.png
 Down frames file: deploypodin_<YourRaceId>.frames
Down sprite sheet: deploypodin_<YourRaceId>.png
