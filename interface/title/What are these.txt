These images serves as the icon for your race in the charactrer creation interface.
If you wish to change these, you can edit them to your heart's content, but for the sake of
mod compatibility, you will need to rename them so that other mods made using this mod template
who forgot to rename these files won't override your character creation icons.

When renaming files please make sure that the name of the files follow these templates:
Female File: <YourRaceId>female.png
  Male File: <YourRaceId>male.png

Where:
  <YourRaceId> is the "kind" value you assigned to your species in your .species file.
