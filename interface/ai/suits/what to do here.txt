NOTE: Not Sure if that is still used in the game but since the game asset still contains them,
we recommend to keep these.

Pre 1.0 these were used in the ai console to assign techs but we have no idea whay they do anymore.

When renaming files please make sure that the name of the files follow these templates:
Female file:<YourRaceId>-male.png
  Male file:<YourRaceId>-female.png

Where:
  <YourRaceId> is the "kind" value you assigned to your species in your .species file.
