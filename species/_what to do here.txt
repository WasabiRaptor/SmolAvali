These files are the most important files for your race as they allow you to configure the main settings of your species.

When renaming files please make sure that the name of the files follow these templates:
   .species file: <YourRaceId>.species
body config file: <YourRaceId>bodyconfig.config or <YourRaceId>oid.config
   name gen file: <YourRaceId>namegen.config

Where:
  <YourRaceId> is the "kind" value you assigned to your species in your .species file.
