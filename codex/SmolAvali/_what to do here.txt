These are the codexes your race will either have unlocked by default or by finding them while adventuring.

By convention we name the codex files and icons using this template:
codexes: <YourRaceId>history<CodexNumber>
  icons: <YourRaceId>cover<CoverNumber>

Where:
  <YourRaceId> is the kind/raceid you assinged to your species in your .species file.
  <CodexNumber> is a number identifying the option uniquely, usually starting by 1.
  <CoverNumber> is a number identifying the option uniquely, usually starting by 1.
