The "SmolAvali" folder should be renamed to the name that the "kind" value in your.species file is set to.
Here you aren't obligated to rename the folder but by convention all the codex files that are realted to your race
should be contained in the codex folder with the name of your race.

For example, if your race id/kind is "trols", the folder would be renamed to "trols"
